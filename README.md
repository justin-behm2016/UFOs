# UFOs
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to provide a webpage that included a way for user to access a more in-depth analysis of reported UFO sightings. This was achieved by providing a wider variety of filters to narrow data down. thus allowing a user to filter the data by date, city, state, country, or shape.
### Results
The new filtering process for the webpage will allow a more interactive experience for the user. This is due to a greater level of ability of the user to comb through the UFO sighting data.

As seen in the image above, a potential example could be a user filtering through the data for sightings in the US that have the shape of a circle. 

![filter_example_2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111502918/200464657-d42570f1-f0f0-4b70-9bc9-848797412c75.PNG)

As a further example, a user could have used some of the information gained from the previous search and then decide to look further into any sightings reported in OH. The second image displayed shows some of the information they could find.

#### Summary
The new design is certainly an improvement; however, there are ways to improve it even further. One improvement I would suggest would be a form of community interaction. The inclusion of something like a comment section, a forum, or any form of discussion within the community would address a current lack thereof. I think the inclusion of something like this allows for the topic of UFO sightings to become a talking point.
A second form of improvement I would suggest comes in another form of community interaction. Currently, the data set is stagnant and some points are a bit dated. Allowing a way for users to submit their own UFO sightings both increases user interaction and revitalizes the dataset. I would only suggest this in a way that allows the submissions to be reviewed before being posted to the webpage to ensure the sightings are presentable.
